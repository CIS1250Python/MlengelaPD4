The Program - RPS-PLAY A GAME - does the following: 
1. Initialize an empty list that you will use to store the results of each game.
2.  Start a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user:
   *  a.) The user will play against the computer. A scissor can cut paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock.
   * b.) Open a do-while loop as a play loop. That way, the player can play the game until the user or the computer has won twice.
   * c.) Ask the user to select his/her choice (rock, paper, scissors).
   * d.) After the user has entered his/her choice, the program uses a random number generator for its selection.
   * e.) The program will evaluate who won or if there was a lie.
   * f.) The program reports what the computer chose, the user's choice, who won that round, and the game tally.
        The game tally shows the number of rounds, wins, losses for the player, and the number of ties.
   *  g.) Ask the player if the user wants to play again.
   * h.) When done, display a goodbye message:
3. The program should look something like the following:
